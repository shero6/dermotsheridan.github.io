My research aims to enhance athlete monitoring by leveraging training load data collected from wearable sensors to develop predictive models that optimize training management and athlete performance in team sports. By integrating advanced data analytics with routinely collected training data, I focus on creating data-driven solutions that support coaches and sports scientists in making informed decisions to improve training outcomes and reduce injury risk.

Current Research Projects
======

Machine Learning Approach for Predicting RPE Using GNSS Wearable Sensors
------
This project explores how machine learning can be used to predict athletes' Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) using GNSS data. By developing models that capture the complexity of external load metrics, I aim to provide a more accurate and actionable understanding of training demands.

Estimating VO2 During Team Sports from IMU Wearable Sensors Data
------
This project focuses on estimating oxygen consumption (VO2) using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. The goal is to create robust models for physiological monitoring during team sports, providing deeper insights into athlete conditioning and metabolic demands during high-intensity activities.

Automating Event Detection in Team Sports Using Wearable Sensor Data
------
This research investigates automating the detection of key events and phases during sports activities using GNSS and IMU data. The project aims to develop algorithms that can recognize and classify complex movement patterns to enhance tactical and performance analysis.


Research Goals
------
Through my research, I strive to create innovative data-driven methods that can be applied in real-world training environments, helping practitioners optimise training load management, prevent injuries, and enhance overall athlete performance.
